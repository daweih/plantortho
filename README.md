Plant Homolog Database ([PHD](http://homolog.ic4r.org)) is a database composed of plant homologous genes. It combines phylogenetic and heuristic best-match approaches, yielding an accurate collection of more than 14,000 homologous groups covering multiple different species (including rice, Arabidopsis thaliana, tomato, maize, sorghum, etc).

PHD provides highly interactive visualizations of multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree, natural selection at each tree node/branch site, and duplication/speciation events which can be used for inference of ortholog, in-paralogs and out-paralogs.
